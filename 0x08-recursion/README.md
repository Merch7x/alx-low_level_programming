<h2>Tasks</h2>

| Task | File |
| ---- | ---- |
| 0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget | [0-puts_recursion.c](./0-puts_recursion.c) |
| 1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together | [1-print_rev_recursion.c](./1-print_rev_recursion.c) |
| 2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange | [2-strlen_recursion.c](./2-strlen_recursion.c) |
| 3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling | [3-factorial.c](./3-factorial.c) |
| 4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate | [4-pow_recursion.c](./4-pow_recursion.c) |
| 5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer | [5-sqrt_recursion.c](./5-sqrt_recursion.c) |
| 6. Inception. Is it possible? | [6-is_prime_number.c](./6-is_prime_number.c) |
| 7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything | [100-is_palindrome.c](./100-is_palindrome.c) |
| 8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible... | [101-wildcmp.c](./101-wildcmp.c) |
